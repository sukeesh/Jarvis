Dispatcher mechanism for creating event models

PyDispatcher is an enhanced version of Patrick K. O'Brien's
original dispatcher.py module.  It provides the Python
programmer with a robust mechanism for event routing within
various application contexts.

Included in the package are the robustapply and saferef
modules, which provide the ability to selectively apply
arguments to callable objects and to reference instance
methods using weak-references.
