IMDbPY is a Python package useful to retrieve and
manage the data of the IMDb movie database about movies, people,
characters and companies.

Platform-independent and written in pure Python (and few C lines),
it can retrieve data from both the IMDb's web server and a local copy
of the whole database.

IMDbPY package can be very easily used by programmers and developers
to provide access to the IMDb's data to their programs.

Some simple example scripts - useful for the end users - are included
in this package; other IMDbPY-based programs are available at the
home page: http://imdbpy.sf.net/
