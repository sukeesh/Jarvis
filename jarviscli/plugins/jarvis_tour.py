                    Proton Compatible Game Plugin Tutorial
                    
                    1. Start the Plugin
                       Type:
                       Proton game
                    
                    2. Usage Options
                       Choose from:
                       1 - Provide Steam game AppId
                       2 - Provide Steam game Title
                       3 - Close
                    
                    3. Using AppId (Option 1)
                       - Enter the Steam game AppId when prompted
                       - Get the ProtonDB rating for the game
                    
                    4. Using Game Title (Option 2)
                       - Enter the Steam game title when prompted
                       - Plugin searches for the game and retrieves its AppId
                       - Get the ProtonDB rating for the game
                    
                    5. Notes
                       - Option 2 may not find the game or find an incorrect game
                       - For accurate results, use Option 1 with the correct AppId from Steam
                       - If the game is not found or has no ratings, you'll receive an error message
                    
                    6. Example
                       Proton game
                       Enter your choice: 1
                       Enter Game AppId: 570
                       Output: Displays ProtonDB rating for the game (e.g., AppId 570 is Dota 2)
                    
                    7. Closing the Plugin
