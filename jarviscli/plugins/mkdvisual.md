!!!!!!ONE by Terrence Mosley !!Son: Nope. Picked up the blade when at 14 and never looked back. Ma never wanted me to shave. I thought she didn’t want me to grow up, or something like that, but now I understand. She would always say to me… every time, she would say, “It’s gonna grow back thicker”. First couple times weren’t too bad. A little irritation, no cuts, everything was fine. Next thing I know, I start getting all these bumps. I would let it grow out, they would disappear, and I would shave again. I would get more, every time I shaved, and I started to pick at them. I couldn’t pop’em fast enough. Then it started feeling like I had steel pushing out of my pores. Sometimes it’s so bad I can’t sleep at night. Ma tried to warn me and I didn’t listen. I would go to bed mad at you. Thinkin’ you did this to me. Try and put you out of my head and there you are just beneath the surface pushing up. Pushing pain.
