'''
This class allows storage of values in json format. It adds an easy
Interface to save values to disk.

The SAVE FUNCTION MUST BE RAN BEFORE THE OBJECT IS DESTROYED. This was by design
to limit the amount of time spent writing to disk.

This class creates a file called memory.json to store its data. If the
file doesnt exists it creates it and if it has already been created it loads
the data to memory.


example:
    m = Memory()
    name = m.get_data('firstName')
    m.add_data('lastName', 'albert')
    m.save()
'''
# this sets the path to the modules directory not the directory it was
# call from
module_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
