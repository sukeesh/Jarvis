![Jarvis](http://i.imgur.com/xZ8x9ES.jpg)

Jarvis is a simple personal assistant for Linux, MacOS and Windows which works on the command line. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can tell you the weather, he can find restaurants and other places near you. He can do some great stuff for you.

## Getting Started With Installation

In order to install Jarvis, follow these steps:
1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis.git) with `git clone https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis.git`
2. Run the command `python installer` (or `python3 installer` if that doesn't work) from the terminal.

Run **Jarvis** from anywhere by command `jarvis`, or `./jarvis` from within the project directory to start up Jarvis!

You can start by typing `help` within the Jarvis command line to check what Jarvis can do for you.
